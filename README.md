# -metapopulation-networks-space-in-ecology

In ecological modeling, understanding space—how species and populations are
distributed across landscapes or within habitats—is crucial because it affects everything
from how organisms interact with each other to how they move, compete, or cooperate.
Here, we practice the context of network theory, adjacency matrices, and matrix
multiplication. Let’s start with the matrix manipulation.

etapopulation ecologists use matrix algebra and the network theory
to study the dynamics of spatially connected populations. In metapopulation networks,
each habitat patch is seen as a network node, and dispersal is seen as a network link.
Nodes and links are concepts from the network theory.
